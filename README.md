## [btree-dotnet](https://github.com/markmeeus/btree-dotnet):
"Simple BTree implemention in C#, developed and tested in Visual Studio 2012.
This is an in-memory implementation currently and does not have its state persisted to disk yet.
Since this BTree implementation has Database in mind, each key added to the key has a correspondent pointer (which would be a pointer to a disk block).
This implementation is based on the chapter on BTrees in "Introduction to Algorithms", by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest."
